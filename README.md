# Cat Clicker Premium Pro App
### Everyone Loves Cat Apps... Right?

## Getting Started
* To view offline ```git clone https://github.com/TySabs/Cat-Clicker-Pro.git```
and open up ```index.html``` in a browser

* View Cat Clicker Online: [Cat Clicker Premium Pro](https://tysabs.github.io/Cat-Clicker-Pro/)

## How It Works
* The user can choose to display five different cat pictures
* The user can then click on each cat and watch that cat's click count go up
* As each cat's click count grows, the cat's title increases to stronger cats
* To reset the click count, refresh the browser

## Purpose of this Project
* This project's goal was to build an app with Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture using the Knockout JavaScript Library
* The app has a ***Model*** for holding data and a ***View*** for display and never the twain shall meet
* The ***View Model*** (aka Octopus) acts as the decision maker and the glue between the ***Model*** and ***View***
